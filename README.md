### Creating a kanban board with [ReactJS](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn) & [ViteJS](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)
### Using the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/)

## Introduction
1. We stick with React
2. We use Typescript to type and reduce the risk of failures when it is necessary to scale the software
3. We use viteJS to facilitate building and production, taking webpack from the project, we gained in transpilation speed compared to the WebPack bundle
4. Used bootstrap to facilitate responsiveness and faster styling and following a clear and objective pattern for those who will maintain the code in the future
5. ReactJS was chosen because it is a widely used framework, with a simple ecosystem, easy maintenance, extensive documentation in the developer community, excellent scalability
6. The MVC like design pattern was used due to the ease of implementation, extensive knowledge of the developer community
7. Local persistence of data was chosen for the ease of implementation and can be readily replaced by any database, relational/non-relational
8. The project is under MIT license (free)
9. Feature: A technical documentation in Markdown will be produced for ease of use/improvement by other developers, but, basically you set ```yarn install``` and after this ```yarn build``` or ```yarn run build```, if is necessary running the code on localhost do you need typing```yarn dev```.

1. Added Dark/White mode button (initial attempt to implement accessibility/visual comfort)

Future features (after the end of the course)
1. Multi-user login system (social and Sign Up authentication [email registration])
2. Database Refactoring
3. Color system by Card and Task
4. Alert for a number greater than 4 lanes created (in order to alert the user that the process is making the process less agile)
